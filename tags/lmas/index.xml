      <description>Overview and IntroductionDriven by the desire to do something as fun and interesting as this post by the folks at Decision Science, I decided to dust off some previous work done on Louisville Metro Animal Services Animal [“LMAS”] Intake and Outcome data (you can get it here). The problems are sort of the same at the core - while the linked work focuses on customer churn, this analysis will focus on what information tends to predict a given animal will be euthanized at LMAS using Artificial Neural Networks (“ANN”).</description>

      <description>Overview and IntroductionThe bulk of this work - including methodology and data sources (and fun visuals!) - currently sits in the blog section if you want to read through it. This write-up provides only a quick synopsis of the work covered there, and any learnings.
There were a number of key findings in the analysis that could be of use.</description>
