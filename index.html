<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Eric Bickel - and independent consultant looking to use data to help clients solve problems. Most of this site houses personal analysis and write-ups on interesting tools and datasets that I&rsquo;ve come across while nerding out - but I hope that as a portfolio, they are interesting and fun to read while also showcasing some of what I can help clients out with!</p>

<h3 id="what-i-offer">What I Offer</h3>

<p>As an analyst, I have over ten years of experience working with data to build new tools and drive new insights. In my day job, I manage a team of data scientists within a large spirits manufacturer - linking data to insight for business customers. I bring a wealth of knowledge of statistical modeling and business acumen, and tons of experience of all the buzzwords in between.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve been doing this long enough that I know the difference between what <strong>can</strong> be done and what <strong>should</strong> be done. Armed with this, I can build strategic and operational tools driven by data and armed with research to help make strong decisions.</p>

<h3 id="get-in-touch">Get In Touch</h3>

<p>If you are interested in working together, please feel free to <a href="mailto:huckleberryinsights@gmail.com">email me</a> or reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/_huckleberryIO">Twitter</a>.

<div id="overview-and-introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview and Introduction</h2>
<p>The bulk of this work - including methodology and data sources (and fun visuals!) - currently sits in the <a href="%22https://huckleberryinsights.github.io/blog/%22">blog</a> section if you want to read through it. This write-up provides only a quick synopsis of the work covered there, and any learnings.</p>
<p>There were a number of key findings in the analysis that could be of use. First and foremost, euthanasia rates seem to be on the decline over the years. In 2007, euthanasias peaked at just north of 10,000 and so far through 2017 they’re just south of 1,000 - which is just 10% of their peak a decade ago. You can see the steady decline in the chart below:</p>
<p>However, over the same period total intake has also declined (althought, not quite as significantly as euthanasias). Intake rates peaked in 2008 at nearly 18,000 animals and currently are just under 9,000 for 2017. This 50% decline would certainly imply that in total - there are fewer animals for LMAS to euthanize. This is important to keep in mind, as declines in euthanasia rates are going to be dependent upon this larger trend!</p>
<p>To normalize this, we can look at share of euthanasias against intake numbers per year. This at least helps us control for the single variable of the overall trend in intake numbers. This cut of the analysis shows that the share of euthanasias follows the downward trends observed for euthanasias and intake overall - a good sign for LMAS that their lower intake numbers are at least somewhat distributed toward animals that may have historically been euthanized!</p>
</div>
<div id="deeper-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Deeper Analysis</h2>
<p>Of course - I wanted to get deeper into it. Despite the downward trend in euthanasia, it was interesting to me that we are still seeing double-digit shares in euthanasia rates of total intake. To better understand <em>why</em> this is the case, I utilized an <a href="%22https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/ann-work-simplified/%22">Artificial Neural Network</a> model to create predictions around which animals were most likely to be euthanized of the current population of animals at LMAS. There were some interesting key findings (please read the blog post for more detailed analysis), but what stood out the most to me was this correlation plot of the most significant variables:</p>
<p><a href="img/correlation_plot.png"></a></p>
<p>The highest risk of euthanasia exists for animals who have unknown intake reasons and/or unknown reproductive statuses while the variable engineered to estimate an animal’s age actually had a negative relationship. The latter insight implies that as animals age - their odds of being euthanized decline. This is an interesting finding as I would have thought the opposite would be true, but this could also be somewhat spurious, temporal as litters of kittens and puppies overpopulate, or a classification issue (by default, I ignored euthanasias that were requested by owners). A deeper dive into the data would be required to parse that out.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I am satisfied with the results of the work. There are obviously limitations here - but with some more time dedicated, they are fixable and I do not believe they will dramatically shift the outcome. In order to help direct individuals to the animals of highest risk to be euthanized, the blog post contains a filterable and searchable list of animals with hyperlinks to their adoption page. Measured against eachother, the list of animals in the table represents those that pose the highest risk of euthanasia from my ANN model. Luckily, LMAS has done a tremendous job at pushing the overall rate of euthanasia lower, but they are not able to save every animal – so please, consider adopting (and consider adopting an animal from that list). The more we adopt, the more LMAS can save!</p>

            <div class="markdown">
            Overview and IntroductionDriven by the desire to do something as fun and interesting as this post by the folks at Decision Science, I decided to dust off some previous work done on Louisville Metro Animal Services Animal [“LMAS”] Intake and Outcome data (you can get it here). The problems are sort of the same at the core - while the linked work focuses on customer churn, this analysis will focus on what information tends to predict a given animal will be euthanized at LMAS using Artificial Neural Networks (“ANN”).
