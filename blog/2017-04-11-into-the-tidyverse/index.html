<h3>Today’s purpose</h3>
<p>To walk through the <code>tidyverse</code> and become familiar with the functions that it provides the user and how it can make your life <em>so much better</em> to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-the-heck-even-is-a-tidyverse" class="section level3">
<h3>What the heck even is a <code>tidyverse</code>?</h3>
<p><a href="http://tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> is a collection of R packages providing an all-inclusive resource for data science (well, <em>almost</em>). When you <code>library(tidyverse)</code> the following packages are loaded up as dependencies:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="23%" />
<col width="76%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Package</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>ggplot2</code></td>
<td>Graphics-building package based on The Grammar of Graphics mapping aesthetics to data visually</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>tibble</code></td>
<td>Wrapper on traditional dataframes allowing for better printing and viewing data</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>tidyr</code></td>
<td>Package to easily and quickly get your data into a rectangular format (if not already in one)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>readr</code></td>
<td>Super fast package for reading in rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>purrr</code></td>
<td>A set of tools for working with functions and vectors for functional programming techniques</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>dplyr</code></td>
<td>Quickly and efficiently manipulate data with a Grammar of Manipulation (just made that up)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Within each of these there are a handful of other dependencies - not all of which I am going to talk through. However, one package that <strong>is</strong> important to know about is <code>magrittr</code>. It is a dependency loaded with <code>dplyr</code> and allows for the use of pipes (the <code>%&gt;%</code> character) - which is an extremely strong character and provides the user the ability to “pipe through” elements into functions for manipulation/modeling/visualizing. That probably makes no sense right now, but I promise it will when we walk through an example or two.</p>
</div>
<div id="lets-jump-into-some-examples" class="section level3">
<h3>Let’s jump into some examples</h3>
<p>Probably the best way to learn a thing in R is to do a thing in R - so let’s do that. I made a promise years ago not to ever use <code>iris</code> or <code>mtcars</code> in my examples, so instead we are going to mess around with the <code>babynames</code> dataset (another gem from Hadley Wickham) for this first example.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s load in our packages and set a theme for plotting</strong></p>
<p>Aside from our <code>tidyverse</code> package, we are also going to load in the <code>babynames</code> package that houses baby names for the US from 1880 to 2014 for all names used by at least five children of either sex for every year. It also has cohort life tables, which is pretty interesting to mess around with as well. The data is provided by the Social Security Administration - so you <em>know</em> it’s legit.</p>
<p>We’re also loading in <code>extrafont</code> to access fonts that exist on my local machine and <code>ggthemes</code> to church up plots in ggplot a bit. I’ve added descriptors next to each line of <code>ggthemes::theme_set</code> to help understand what each does.</p>

<p><strong>Peek into some of the data</strong></p>
<p>Honing in first on the lifetales, we have a number of options in R to get a feel for what the data looks like. In base R, we can use <code>str</code> to identify the class of each variable (assuming your data is rectangular) as well as the first few rows of each.</p>
<p>However, in <code>tidyverse</code> we have <code>tibble::glimpse</code> - which provides a cleaner view of the underlying data, and will always render the data even if it is stored remotely in a database.</p>

<p><strong>Do some quick visual exploration</strong></p>
<p>This is where it starts to get fun (assuming you aren’t already having fun) - exploring the data visually. We know from our source what the definition of each variable is. For instance, we know that variable <code>x</code> is age in years; we know that <code>lx</code> is the number of individuals alive at year <code>x</code>; we know the number of survivors by <code>sex</code>; and we know the number of survivors across each <code>year</code>. With this data, we can calculate a weighted average age for each sex for each year using a handful of <code>dplyr</code> functions. We can then pass this data through to be visualized using <code>ggplot</code> - quickly visualizing some trends!</p>

<p><strong>Build some models</strong></p>
<p>Another use-case for the <code>tidyverse</code> family would be applying a function across a dataframe. In the old days, this would be done either through the <code>apply</code> family or via a good ol’ <code>for</code> loop. However, with <code>purrr</code> comes the handy <code>map</code> function - which will allow you to <em>map</em> a function across your data.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to be crazy and model the propensity of a given name over time. In other words, we are going to model the change in the number of individual names as a function of time. To set this up, we are going to dive back into the <code>babynames</code> package, and export out the dataframe of names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># First, let&#39;s nest all of the data for each name into their own column
by.name &lt;- babynames %&gt;%              # Feed the babynames data into the next function

<h3>What else can <code>tidyverse</code> do?</h3>
<p>There are an insane number of functions embedded into <code>tidyverse</code> - far more than a single tutorial can cover. We hit on some of the main packages today with <code>dplyr</code> for quick data manipulation and <code>ggplot</code> for good-looking visualization, but packages like <code>purrr</code> and <code>tidyr</code> can help to take manipulation even further prior to visualization.</p>
<p>To learn more about how you can use <code>tidyverse</code> and its dependencies, check out <a href="http://tidyverse.org/">the official page</a> or read Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. Go make cool stuff!</p>
